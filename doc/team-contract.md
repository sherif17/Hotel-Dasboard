# Team Work Contract

We, Cameron Harris, Chen Zhao, Sakshi Jain, Trevor Kinsey, agree with the information documented in our team contract, and will try our best to uphold this charter. By pushing this document in our GitHub repository, we indicate our commitment to our team. All members of the group are to make equal efforts for the success of the group presentation. All group members are to fulfill the responsibilities of completing the assignment and making strong efforts for success related to group role expectations.

## Meeting strategies:

- Come to lectures, labs and group meetings on time (If I miss a group meeting, I will inform the group members ahead of time)
- Meet every Friday at 2:00 pm PST
- Meet to make release on Saturday as a group
- Let the group know of any black out dates, or schedule conflicts you have 3 days in advance
- If a person depends on your work, aim to have it done a few days early

## Meeting schedules:

## Attitudes:

- Be open to constructive criticism and be respectful when giving it
- Celebrate successes
- It is OK to ask for help if you need it

## Decision making and conflict resolution:
